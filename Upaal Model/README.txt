Assignment 2: Modelling a DDD Mode Pacemaker in UPPAL model checker.
Course: MicroController and Embedded Systems

// ===================================================================================== //
Find the Uppal Model under DDD_Pacemaker.xml. All the 8 queries have been commented properly to easily identify.

A few nomenclature changes made: A Atrial/Ventricular SENSED event (i.e. after the wait times PVARP, VRP resp. ) 
are represented ASense, VSense. While the raw signals are reresented as AS, VS. Keep this in mind to avoid confusion while
checking the model.
